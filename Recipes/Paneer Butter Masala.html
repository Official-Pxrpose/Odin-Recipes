    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Paneer Butter Masala is a preparation of paneer, native to the Indian subcontinent, consisting of a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes and Indian spices. Originating with the creamy delicacies of Mughlai cuisine, this dish is prepared by emulsifying tomatoes, onions, ground cashews, clarified butter and cream into a curry, with the addition of paneer cubes and a variety of spices.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter, Oil and Cream</li>
        <li>Dried Kashmiri Red Chillies</li>
        <li>Onions & Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>Cashew nuts</li>

        <li>Spices </li>
        <li>Tomato Ketchup</li>
        <li>Kasuri Methi </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with wrapping the spices in a muslin or cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni. This helps add all the flavour without having to fish out the spices one by one later</li>
        <li>Cook the kashmiri chillies, onion, tomato, cashew, poppy seeds and spices together till the tomatoes are soft and pulpy. This is the base of the gravy</li>
        <li>Remove the bouquet garni (whole spices) and the blend the onion tomato paste to really smooth. You can add some water if required</li>
        <li>Simmer the gravy along with powdered spices and salt in butter for 10-15 minutes till you can see a little oil floating to the top</li>
        <li>Smoke the gravy with my dungar method (see video). This takes the gravy to the next level!</li>
        <li>Add kasuri methi, paneer and cream, cook for a minute or two and you are done!</li>
    </ol>
